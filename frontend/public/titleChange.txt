To change the title of each page in a React.js application, you can use the react-helmet library. This library allows you to manage the document head, including the page title, from within your components.

Steps to Change Page Titles
Install react-helmet: Run the following command in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-helmet
Use Helmet Component: In each page component, use the Helmet component to set the title. Here's how you can do it:

Example: Setting the Page Title
1. Home.js
javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

const Home = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Helmet>
                <title>Home - ProjectFlowFinder</title>
            </Helmet>
            <h1>Welcome to Home Page</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Home;
2. About.js
javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

const About = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Helmet>
                <title>About Us - ProjectFlowFinder</title>
            </Helmet>
            <h1>About Our Project</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default About;
